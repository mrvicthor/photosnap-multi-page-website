## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project gave me the opportunity to work with grid and flexbox to build responsive layouts.

### Continued development

I intend to build a more dynamic website so i can implement some of the knowledge of grid and flexbox layouts.

### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the basic concepts of react. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
